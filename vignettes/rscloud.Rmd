The rscloud package is meant to provide the R user with access to the REST based APIs available in rstudio.cloud.  To get started, you will need to retrieve your CLIENT_KEY and CLIENT_SECRET and store them in a config.yml file (TODO: This may end up being a better .Renviron thing  I don't know).  

This package will provide you with the ability to:

* Invite users to a space
* Add/remove users from a space
* Discover the roles in a space
* Create/Delete a space (TBD)
