The rscloud package is meant to provide the R user with access to the REST based APIs available in rstudio.cloud.  To get started, you will need to retrieve your CLIENT_KEY and CLIENT_SECRET and store them in a config.yml file.  Before running through any of the functions, you need to call the initialize_token function.  This will establish a connection that should be valid for 60 minutes.  You can call the refresh_token function if you need to run additional commands post the 60 minutes.

This package will provide you with the ability to:

* Invite users to a space
* Add/remove users from a space
* Discover the roles in a space
* Create/Delete a space (TBD)
